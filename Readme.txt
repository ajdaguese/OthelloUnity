Othello:
Take turns against your opponent placing pieces on the board. Player 1 is white, player 2 is black.
When you place a piece of your color, you convert your opponents pieces to yours by flipping over every piece between your newly placed piece and 
one of your existing tokens in a straight line.
You can play your piece on your turn by clicking on the square of the board that you would like to occupy.

Setup:
Before you begin you have to choose the difficulty at which you wish to play and whether you want to go first or second.
First type the difficulty level in the given text box (valid difficulties are 1-10) then click play first or play second.
Make sure you have the difficulty entered before clicking one of the buttons. The button will lock your difficulty into palce,
if a valid difficulty is not selected it will set it to 5.
